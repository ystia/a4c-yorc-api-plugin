# Alien4Cloud plugin exposing Rest API to interact with Yorc's REST API

This plugin should be considered as experimental. Its primary intention is to ease integration testing in cases where Yorc's API is
not accessible directly.

## Downloads

Plugin zip file that could be imported directly in Alien4Cloud could be downloaded from the 
[project release page](https://github.com/ystia/a4c-yorc-api-plugin/releases). 

We also provide a [Maven Github Packages repository](https://github.com/ystia/a4c-yorc-api-plugin/packages/).
See [Github help](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages)
to know how to configure it.
